|             Use Left/Right key to make movement              |         Use Space key to jump and turn on the light          |

Follow Bob's instruction, go straight and precisely turn on the lights.

## 03/ Future Plans

- Design more levels and inprove complexity

  - Larger and higher building with multiple rooms

    Since you have achieved these tasks perfectly, Hitomi and Bob maintained a good relationship so that Bob could expand his business sucessfully and bought a bigger building!

  - More complicated orders

    Boss may not figure out what they want, but they can still order anything! The instructions of lights will become more complicated and abstract:

    - "I want the center room on each floor to light up, and I also want the lights in the rooms on both sides of the building to light up as well."
    - "1 is my lucky number, I want all rooms whose room number contains the number 1 to light up."
    - "I want to give my beloved girl stars in the sky. Light up non-adjacent rooms as many as possible"
    - “I want a sun to rise over my  building, like my brightest beauty lights up my heart.”
  
- Add more functions and details

  - Menu design
  - Data management
  - Multiplayers
  - Reverse mode(Eg. turn lights off)
